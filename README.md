# Adjustable spool holder for Prusa I3

This is my shot at making a spool holder for Prusa I3 Family.

## Summary

After looking at so many designs by many people on thingiverse, I couldn't find a design that originally wanted, so I decided to design my own that has the functionality as I imagined. My design includes automatically centering of your spool when you adjust the spool holder, that means when you adjust from a wider spool to narrow spool, both left roller and right roller will move independently from/to each other when you turn the knob. The main design was borrowed from Aero3D as it's a good design from the start, but lacking the auto centering of spools as I described earlier.

## My Print Choice

I decided to print mine in pla, mainly because it's cheaper and easier to print with pla and doesn't have a big risk of warpage if you print without a heat chamber. For my spool holder I decided to use black and white pla as it will match my Prusa printer, but you can choose what ever color you'd like.

## Infill Config

The infill config I chose for my spool holder was 20% infill. For some people they have difficulty choosing the settings so i took the liberty and made a excel chart with all the necessary info for you to print the spool holder. If you follow the settings I provided correctly, you should have no problem printing and assembling it later.
(NOTE: DO NOT MESS WITH THE PARTS ORIENTATION WHEN YOU LOAD THE STL FILES INTO PRUSA CLICER!)
