# Adjustable spool holder for Prusa I3
This is my shot at making a spool holder for Prusa I3 Family.
## Summary
After looking at so many designs by many people on thingiverse, I couldn't find a design that originally wanted, so I decided to design my own that has the functionality as I imagined. My design includes automatically centering of your spool when you adjust the spool holder, that means when you adjust from a wider spool to narrow spool, both left roller and right roller will move independently from/to each other when you turn the knob. The main design was borrowed from Aero3D as it's a good design from the start, but lacking the auto centering of spools as I described earlier.
